## ABOUT PROJECT

# APIManager-Flutter

`APIManager-Flutter` is an API manager for flutter applications that can manage
the API calls from a single place.<br>

# üîÆ What's an API?

<br> When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects
to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data,
interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone.
The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information
you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens via
API.<br>

# üí° What's Unique?

<br> The handling of APIs is usually messy. So here we present to you a much
simplified way to beautifully handle the API calls.
